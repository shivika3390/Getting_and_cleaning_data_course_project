# Getting_and_cleaning_data_course_project
This repo contains the files of the Course Project work.

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
  1. Downloads and unzip the dataset.
  2. Reads and loads the training and test datasets.
  3. Merges the two datasets.
  4. Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  5. Gives labels to the dataset with descriptive variables.
  6. Finally creates a tidy dataset (tidydata.txt) that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

Also, this repo consists of codebook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
